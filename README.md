# ML_Tuts
This repo contains different tutorials I have worked through in Machine Learning

We leave in a world where a lot of data is generated every second, most of it in text format as this is how humans communicate
My aim is to deliver ways in which computers can interpret this text information and help analysts quickly draw meaningful insights from the corpus. 

This can be done through Natural Learning Processes (NLP), Clustering and Regression techniques, Unsupervised and Supervised Learning.
