    "### Recommendation Engine Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used for this recomendation engine uses the names of the FATHERS of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "* In this tut, _collaborative filtering_ is used\n",
    "* The idea behind collaborative filtering is that if person A likes 1,2,3 and B likes 2, 3, 4 then they have similar interests. A should love 4 and B should love 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* The other form of recommendation Engine not used here is _Content Based Algorithms_.\n",
    "* Content based algorithms assume if you like a specific kind of item... e.g movies with a particular genre, then you will like another movie in that genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data is in a dictionary that contains the items (cs system books) and a relative score the scientists attached to them\n",
    "* We seek to determine which books the different scientists are most likely to read based on how they rated the ones they had read\n",
    "* First we determine how similar people are based on thei ranking\n",
    "* We then find an adequate similarity score using _Euclidean Distance_ and _Pearson Correlation Coefficient_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Distance Score\n",
    "* The Euclidean distance between two points is the length of the line segments connecting them.\n",
    "* The Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the \"ordinary\" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Two people belong to a certain preference space if and only if they have ranked the two items that define that preference space. \n",
    "* The closer two people are in a preference space, the closer their similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "* The Pearson correlation Coefficient is a measure of the linear dependance or correlation between two variables X and Y\n",
    "We use the common datapoints (common fields/books) between 2 people so as to determine the similarity between users\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plotting these would give us a positive or negative slope indicating the correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommending\n",
    "* Using the methods above, we can then make a calculated guess on what the Scientist would find interesting\n",
    "* These methods help us find the closest person to a specific person\n",
    "\n",
    "* For normalisation, all the ratings on a book by the different readers can be taken into account\n",
    "* All the ratings by the other users are multiplied by the rating of a specific person. They are then divided by the weight of the sum of the people that have similar preferences."
